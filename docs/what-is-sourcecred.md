title: What is SourceCred?
---
My edits of the closed manifesto PR #85

So I suggest three things: create more narrative structure so that the reader flows from idea to idea in a way that builds on itself, use concrete examples over abstract descriptions, and exercise your "voice" as an author which makes a reader feel more connected and engaged.

Here's the narrative structure I created from the content of your draft:

* Set up the problem
* Imagine a new world
* The solution of SourceCred (and an overview of how it works)
* Vision, growth, and our community
* Conclusion and call to action\
  Each of my comments describes one of these topics in more depth.
