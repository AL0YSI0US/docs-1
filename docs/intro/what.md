description: Overview of what SourceCred is and how it works

## A Social Algorithm

SourceCred enables communities to track **cred**, a quantitative metric that shows how much value a contribution
or contributor has added to the community. Cred is calculated by tracking the contributions of a project--and
every contribution that has gone into it--into a network or **contribution graph**. Contributions in the graph earn cred
if they are connected to other important contributions, and contributors earn cred if they create
high-cred contributions.

## An Economic System

Once a community is up-and-running with cred, they can begin to issue **grain**. Grain is a community-controlled
digital currency that is distributed based on cred scores. Thus, a contributor earns grain, and a sponsor can
support that contributor by buying their grain.

Grain represents your skin in the game within a community. You can use your grain to vote on values, and to set priorities.
In particular, you can use your grain to **boost** contributions, in which case they will earn more cred.
You earn a share of the contribution's future cred, which means you're rewarded if you boost valuable work.

## For Postcapitalist Communities

SourceCred is being built because we believe we need a new way to organize communities. We need communities
that are decentralized but productive; communities that can operate in an open-source way, with everyone
contributing their ideas and value, but that can also pay and support their core contributors. We believe that
SourceCred opens the door to a new generation of organizations that can outcompete corporations and bring about
human empowerment.
